@{{reviewer}} is now a collaborator on [{{repoOwner}}/{{repo}}](/{{repoOwner}}/{{repo}}). Happy reviewing!

Meanwhile, I'll prepare the repository for review by copying files from the [{{repoOwner}}/{{assignment}}](/{{repoOwner}}/{{assignment}}) repo to help make reviewing easier! Bear with me as it might take me some time. I'm just a poor bot, nobody loves me ðŸ¤– ðŸŽ¶
