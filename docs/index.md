# Getting started with Bot ðŸ¤–

Lets assume that we want to introduce [a technical assessment](https://github.com/beat-interviewing/example) to one of the stages of our interview plan. The assessment requires candidates to implement a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence. There is some scaffolding included in this assignment. Enough to provide some structure for the candidate, and some tests that can verify whether the solution is correct. We ask candidates to implement `FibFn()`.

We will rely on Bot to manage the lifecycle of this interview stage. The lifecycle consists of the following parts:

- [Creating a challenge for a candidate](./01-challenge.md)
- Inviting the candidate to collaborate
- Revoking candidates access
- Reviewing the candidates submission
- Grading the assignment

To kick things off, lets challenge candidate [@BillMcKay](https://github.com/BillMcKay) to take this assessment. To learn how to do that, head over to the read the [Creating a challenge for a candidate](01-challenge.md) guide.
