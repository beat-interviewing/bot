# Join

To invite the candidate we'll use the `/join` command. At the comments section 
of the [issue](https://github.com/beat-interviewing/example-live/issues/5) we
created in the previous step, we'll post a comment.

At the comment section, we created a new comment with the message:

> /join @billmckay

And in a few moments, Bot replies to us with the message:

> Granted @billmckay access to beat-interviewing/example-live-billmckay-esl

The candidate should have received an email, inviting them to collaborate. Once
the invitation is accepted, they will have full access to their assessment 
repository.

The interview is ready to begin. 

Once the interview is over, we can [review the completed assignment]().

> _NOTE:_ We can use the join command multiple times. For example to invite
> interviewers.
